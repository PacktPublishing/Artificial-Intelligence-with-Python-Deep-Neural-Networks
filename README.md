# Artificial Intelligence with Python - Deep Neural Networks [Video]
This is the code repository for [Artificial Intelligence with Python - Deep Neural Networks [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-with-python-deep-neural-networks-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789132670), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
The course is an introduction to the basics of deep learning methods. We will start with object detection and tracking, in which we will track faces, objects and eyes. We will then build a neural network and an OCR. We will then learn how to build learning agents that can learn from interacting with the environment. We will use Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks, and use TensorFlow to build neural networks. We will then build an image classifier using convolutional neural networks.
